// Write a recursive function factorial that accepts an integer n as a parameter and returns the factorial of n, or n!.

A factorial of an integer is defined as the product of all integers from 1 through that integer inclusive. For example, the call of factorial(4) should return 1 * 2 * 3 * 4, or 24. The factorial of 0 and 1 are defined to be 1.

You may assume that the value passed is non-negative and that its factorial can fit in the range of type int.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Result{
	static int factorial(int n){
  		    if (n == 0)
            return 1;
        if (n > 0)
            return (n * factorial(n - 1));
        return n;
	}
}

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
      int t = in.nextInt();
      while(t-- > 0){
        int n = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println(Result.factorial(n));
      }
    }
}
